Developing
----------

Master is tracking [trunk](http://code.google.com/p/jsyntaxpane/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk), however, it appears that most of the development work is going on in [branch r096](http://code.google.com/p/jsyntaxpane/source/browse/#svn%2Fbranches%2Fr096%2Fjsyntaxpane).

A [branch](https://github.com/opticyclic/jsyntaxpane/tree/r096) has been created to track this and a [bugfixes branch](https://github.com/opticyclic/jsyntaxpane/tree/bugfixes) has been created from it (at [r151](http://code.google.com/p/jsyntaxpane/source/detail?r=151)) for this repo to fix outstanding bugs.
